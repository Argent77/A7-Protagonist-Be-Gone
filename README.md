# Protagonist-Be-Gone!
*A mod that gets rid of the protagonist, so that Imoen can take her rightful place in the game.*

## Overview

This mod removes the protagonist, so that Imoen can finally take her rightful place in the game. For that reason the mod provides a "slightly" modified start of the BG1 and BG2 parts of the game series. The game expansions (ToB and SoD) have not been altered.

<details>
<summary><strong>Spoiler</strong></summary>
The mod is primarily meant as a joke, since many players complained in the past about Imoen being reduced to a side kick in Charname's adventures.<br />
<br />
It should <em>not</em> be installed for a serious walkthrough.

## Compatibility

The mod supports the following games and game variants:
- Baldur's Gate 2 (with or without ToB)
- Baldur's Gate Trilogy (BGT)
- Tutu/EasyTutu
- BG:EE (with or without SoD)
