Protagonist-Be-Gone!
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Author:   Argent77
Version:  1.0


Overview
~~~~~~~~

In the tradition of "XXX-Be-Gone" mods I present to you "Protagonist-Be-Gone!"
This mod removes the protagonist, so that Imoen can finally take her rightful
place in the game.

For that reason the mod provides a "slightly" modified start of the BG1 and BG2
parts of the game series. The game expansions (ToB and SoD) have not been altered.

It is primarily thought as a joke, since many players complained about Imoen
being reduced to a side kick in Charname's adventures.


Compatibility
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The mod supports the following games and game variants:
- Baldur's Gate 2 (with or without ToB)
- Baldur's Gate Trilogy (BGT)
- Tutu/EasyTutu
- BG:EE (with or without SoD)
- BG2:EE
- Enhanced Edition Trilogy (EET)
