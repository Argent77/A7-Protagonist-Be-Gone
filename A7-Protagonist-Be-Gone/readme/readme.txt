Overview
~~~~~~~~

In the tradition of "XXX-Be-Gone" mods I present to you "Protagonist-Be-Gone!". This mod removes
the protagonist, so that Imoen can finally take her rightful place in the game.

For that reason the mod provides a "slightly" modified start of the BG1 and BG2 parts of the game
series. The game expansions (ToB and SoD) have not been altered.

It is primarily thought as a joke, since many players complained about Imoen being reduced to a
side kick in Charname's adventures, and is *not* meant to be used for a serious walkthrough.


Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is a WeiDU mod, that means it is very easy to install. Simply unpack the downloaded archive
into your game directory and run either "setup-A7-Protagonist-Be-Gone.exe" (Windows) or
"setup-A7-Protagonist-Be-Gone.command" (macOS). Follow the instructions and you are ready to start.

To uninstall, run "setup-A7-Protagonist-Be-Gone.exe" or "setup-A7-Protagonist-Be-Gone.command"
again and follow the prompts.

Note for Siege of Dragonspear (SoD):
GOG and Steam both install the "Siege of Dragonspear" expansion in a way that is not moddable out
of the box. You must install a mod called "DLC Merger" on your SoD installation before this or any
other WeiDU-based mods can be installed.
It can be downloaded from here: https://github.com/Argent77/A7-DlcMerger/releases/latest


Compatibility
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The mod supports the following games and game variants:
- Original Baldur's Gate 2
- Baldur's Gate Trilogy (BGT)
- Tutu/EasyTutu
- BG:EE (with or without SoD)
- BG2:EE
- Enhanced Edition Trilogy (EET)

It should be installed after mods that modify the opening cutscenes, such as Tweaks Anthology's
"Faster Chapter One and Two Cutscenes and Dreams".

The mod is not compatible with "Skip Chateau Irenicus" and "Dungeon Be Gone".
