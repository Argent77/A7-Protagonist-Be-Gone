Overview
~~~~~~~~

In the tradition of "XXX-Be-Gone" mods I present to you "Protagonist-Be-Gone!" This mod removes the
protagonist, so that Imoen can finally take her rightful place in the game.

For that reason the mod provides a "slightly" modified start of the BG1 and BG2 parts of the game
series. The game expansions (ToB and SoD) have not been altered.

It is primarily thought as a joke, since many players complained about Imoen being reduced to a side
kick in Charname's adventures, and is *not* meant to be used for a serious walkthrough.


Compatibility
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The mod supports the following games and game variants:
- Original Baldur's Gate 2
- Baldur's Gate Trilogy (BGT)
- Tutu/EasyTutu
- BG:EE (with or without SoD)
- BG2:EE
- Enhanced Edition Trilogy (EET)

It should be installed after mods that modify the opening cutscenes, such as Tweaks Anthology's
"Faster Chapter One and Two Cutscenes and Dreams".

The mod is not compatible with Skip Chateau Irenicus > More realistic opening cutscene.
